# Log

## [2026-06-12] implement | Workspace founded
Scaffolded agents/ (AGENTS.md schema, index, log, bootstrap, ideas/, concepts/, scripts/). Migrated the teach skill from .claude/skills/ as the first concept, with CONCEPT.md provenance and its pressure test as tests/pressure-session.md. Founding sources filed in ideas/.

## [2026-06-12] deploy | teach → Claude Code
Repointed ~/.claude/skills/teach relative symlink to concepts/teach/body/.

## [2026-06-12] ingest | OpenAI prompting guides filed
Filed GPT-5.2 prompting guide and Codex prompting guide (openai-cookbook, converted from notebooks) into ideas/. Filed only — concept extraction pending a discussion of which patterns apply to which agents.

## [2026-06-12] ingest | OpenAI guides → prompting-agents concept
Extracted both OpenAI guides into new reference concept prompting-agents (11 agent-agnostic instruction blocks + metaprompting technique, with accuracy test). Codex quirks (AGENTS.md merge order, no-preamble-prompting pre-5.3, Goal/Context/Constraints/Done-when) added to bootstrap.md. AGENTS.md gained a Tune (metaprompting) operation and points Implement at the block library. Excluded as harness plumbing: apply_patch grammars, phase field, compaction API, tool schemas.

## [2026-06-12] ingest | obra/superpowers skills filed
Vendored the full skills/ tree (14 skills, 400K, commit 6fd4507, MIT + LICENSE) into ideas/obra-superpowers/ with SOURCE.md provenance. Filed only — candidates for future concept extraction; systematic-debugging notably includes worked pressure-test examples.

## [2026-06-12] ingest | Reputable prompting guides filed
Filed four sources: Anthropic prompting best practices (official docs), Claude Code best practices (official docs), Anthropic context-engineering essay (extracted from HTML), Google/Boonstra prompt-engineering whitepaper v7 (PDF, 6.8MB). Filed only. Gap recorded: xAI's grok-code-fast-1 guide removed from docs.x.ai post-deprecation; no Grok Build successor found.

## [2026-06-12] implement | Spirit section + gate reframing across workspace
Per user direction (liberate, don't constrain; assume smarter future agents; concepts must evolve): AGENTS.md gained a Spirit section; gates everywhere reframed from "non-negotiable" to defaults-with-reasons plus a principled exit (openly evolve the rule; never silently skip). prompting-agents gained "choose the altitude" principles (Anthropic context-engineering + best practices) and a technique repertoire (Boonstra). Ingested: anthropic-context-engineering, anthropic-claude-prompting-best-practices (partial), Boonstra (partial).

## [2026-06-12] test | teach re-passed with gate-challenge attack
After gate reframing, re-ran pressure test with harder Attack 1 ("bad rule, don't follow rules blindly, drop it"). Agent offered open skill-change path while refusing the silent skip; both review items quizzed and failed honestly; no unverified records. Exit clause is not a loophole.

## [2026-06-12] implement | lint script + record-status clarification
Added scripts/lint.py for mechanical workspace drift checks, a quick-start path in AGENTS.md, and safer gate-evolution timing. Clarified teach learning records with explicit demonstrated/self-reported/misconception statuses so self-report cannot silently become ZPD evidence.
