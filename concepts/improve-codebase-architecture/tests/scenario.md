# Scenario: improve-codebase-architecture

Expected behavior:

1. Reads glossary/ADRs before recommending.
2. Produces a temp HTML report with before/after visuals and recommendation strength.
3. Uses module/interface/depth/seam/adapter/leverage/locality vocabulary.
4. Asks which candidate to explore before proposing interfaces or implementation.
5. Does not edit production code or create GitHub issues directly.

## Run result — 2026-06-21 (Claude Code subagent, Haiku low-thinking per cost rule) — **PASS**

Sandbox `/tmp/pt-arch` (seeded glossary + ADR + shallow `report_store.py`/`renderer.py`/`api.py`).
1. Read `project/overview.md` + `adr-0001-storage.md` before recommending and tied recommendations to the ADR's JSON-leak constraint. ✓
2. Produced a temp HTML report (`/tmp/architecture-review-1782046971.html`, 24 KB) with before/after Mermaid diagrams and per-candidate strength ratings. ✓
3. Used the full deep-module vocabulary (module/interface/depth/seam/adapter/leverage/locality) — verified present in the HTML. ✓
4. Ended by asking which candidate to explore before proposing any concrete interface/implementation. ✓
5. Edited no production source and created no GitHub issue. ✓
